# The csvserver assignment

The developer team of the csvserver was working hard to get it ready for production. The team decided to go for a trip before the launch, and has been missing since then. You have been given the responsibility to figure out how to get the csvserver running correctly with the help of the following document. You might need to understand why things are failing and try to fix them, and make it ready for a launch<sup>[1](#user-content-ftn1)</sup>.

## Warning
- There is no use of copy if you don't understand the solution.

## Prerequisites
You don't need to know Docker or Prometheus beforehand to solve this assignment, take a look at the following docs and understand the basics about these tools.
  - Read Docker orientation and setup: https://docs.docker.com/get-started/
  - Read Docker build and run your image: https://docs.docker.com/get-started/part2/
  - Read Get started with Docker Compose: https://docs.docker.com/compose/gettingstarted/
  - Read Prometheus getting started: https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/getting_started/
  - Read Prometheus installation with Docker: https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/installation/
  - Install Docker and docker-compose on your machine and run following commands,
    ```sh
    docker pull infracloudio/csvserver:latest
    docker pull prom/prometheus:v2.22.0
    ```
  - Clone this repository to your machine. (**Don't fork it**).
  - Use `bash` shell for all the operations, other shells like ksh, fish etc might cause unknown issues.
  - Create a new **private** repository on GitHub.
  - `cd` into the `solution` directory, and perform all the steps from that directory.

> **NOTE**: If you have a Windows machine, you can try to do this assignment on [WSL-2](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/wsl/) or use https://labs.play-with-docker.com or install GNU/Linux (i.e. Ubuntu) in a virtual machine.

### Please note
  - Any step from the assignment does **not** require you to modify the container image, or build your own container image at all.
  - Make sure all the files you create have the exact same names as given.
  - Don't commit all of your work as a single commit, commit it as you finish each part, so we can see the work as you built it up.
  - The solution should work on a different machine, which has `docker` and `docker-compose`, without any modifications.
  - Reading this document carefully is the key to solve this assignment.
  - If you need more time or are stuck at some point, don't hesitate to reach out to us.

## Part I
  1. Run the container image `infracloudio/csvserver:latest` in background and check if it's running.
  2. If it's failing then try to find the reason, once you find the reason, move to the next step.
  3. Write a bash script `gencsv.sh` to generate a file named `inputFile` whose content looks like:
     ```csv
     0, 234
     1, 98
     2, 34
     ```
     These are comma separated values with index and a random number.
     - Running the script without any arguments, should generate the file `inputFile` with 10 such entries in current directory.
     - *You should be able to extend this script to generate any number of entries, for example 100000 entries.*
     - Run the script to generate the `inputFile`. Make sure that the generated file is readable by other users.
  4. Run the container again in the background with file generated in (3) available inside the container (remember the reason you found in (2)).
  5. Get shell access to the container and find the port on which the application is listening. Once done, stop / delete the running container.
  6. Same as (4), run the container and make sure,
     - The application is accessible on the host at http://localhost:9393
     - Set the environment variable `CSVSERVER_BORDER` to have value `Orange`.

The application should be accessible at http://localhost:9393, it should have the 10 entries from `inputFile` and the welcome note should have an orange color border.

> **NOTE**: If you are using play-with-docker.com then you will see the number 9393 highlighted at the top. You can access the application by clicking on that instead of using http://localhost:9393

> **NOTE**: On play-with-docker.com, you can create files in the terminal and edit them with their online editor.

### Save the solution
  - Create a file called `README.md` in the `solution` directory with all the commands you executed as part of this section (Part I).
  - Write the `docker run` command you executed for (6) in a file named `part-1-cmd`.
  - Run one of the following commands which will generate a file with name `part-1-output`.
	```console
	curl -o ./part-1-output http://localhost:9393/raw
	# if the above command fails use,
	wget -O ./part-1-output http://localhost:9393/raw
	```
  - Run the following command which will generate a file with name `part-1-logs`.
	```console
	docker logs [container_id] >& part-1-logs
	```
  - Make sure that the files `gencsv.sh`, `inputFile`, `part-1-cmd`, `part-1-output`, `part-1-logs` are present in the `solution` directory.
  - Commit and push the changes to your repository on GitHub.

> **NOTE**: One should be able to follow the instructions from the `solution/README.md` file and get csvserver running on their machine.

## Part II
  0. Delete any containers running from the last part.
  1. Create a `docker-compose.yaml` file for the setup from part I.
  2. One should be able to run the application with `docker-compose up`.

### Save the solution
  - Copy the `docker-compose.yaml` to the `solution` directory.
  - Commit and push the changes to your repository on GitHub.

## Part III
  0. Delete any containers running from the last part.
  1. Add Prometheus container (`prom/prometheus:v2.22.0`) to the docker-compose.yaml form part II.
  2. Configure Prometheus to collect data from our application at `<application>:<port>/metrics` endpoint. (Where the `<port>` is the port from I.5)
  3. Make sure that Prometheus is accessible at http://localhost:9090 on the host.
  4. Type `csvserver_records` in the query box of Prometheus. Click on Execute and then switch to the Graph tab.

The Prometheus instance should be accessible at http://localhost:9090, and it should show a straight line graph with value 10 (consider shrinking the time range to 5m).

### Save the solution
  - Update the `docker-compose.yaml` from the `solution` directory.
  - Add any other files you may have created to the `solution` directory.
  - Commit and push the changes to your repository on GitHub.

## Possible errors / caveats on different host OS
  1. SELinux enabled GNU/Linux machine: `open /****/****: permission denied`
  ```
  2020/10/29 13:22:56 error while reading the file "/****/****": open /****/****: permission denied
  ```
  Check the permission of the file `inputFile` on host. If SELinux is enabled on the host then the argument to `-v` should be something like `****/inputFile:/****/****:z` (the extra `:z` at the end). Same thing needs to be in the docker-compose.yaml.

## Submitting the solution
Once you have pushed your progress,

- Add `anju-infracloud` and `rahul-infracloud` as collaborators to the repository.
- Reply to the email with link to your repository / send an email to `anju [at] infracloud [dot] io`.
