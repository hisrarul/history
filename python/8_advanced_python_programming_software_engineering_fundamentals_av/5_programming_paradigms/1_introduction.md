## Programming Paradigm

A programming paradigm is a style or way of programming.

* Procedural programming
* Functional programming
* Object-Oriented programming

#### Procedural programming
* Most basic form of coding based on the concept of `procedural calls`
* Also called imperative programming paradigm
* Code is structed hierarchically into blocks (loops, conditions)
* Difficult to write and maintain large and complex codes

#### Functional programming
* Uses functions as the fundamental building blocks
* Each function performs a singular task
* Efficient and easy to debug
* Statements in programming may not necessarily follow an order

#### Example of heron's formula
To calculate the heron's formula, we need to perform following things.
* Addition function to find `s`
* Subtract function to find `(s-a)`, `(s-b)` and `(s-c)`
* Multiplication function
* Area

#### Object Oriented Programming
* Groups all the data and code within a single structure(class)
* All data is stored as Classes and objects
* Modular and Organised Code
* Easier to reuse code and reduces redundant code blocks
* Follows bottom up approach
