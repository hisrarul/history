## Object Oriented Programming

* Groups all the data and code within a single structure(class)
* All data is stored as Classes and objects
* Modular and Organised code
* Easier to reuse code and reduces redundant code blocks
* Follows a Bottom-Up approach

#### Concepts of OOP
* Encapsulation
* Polymorphism
* Abstraction
* Inheritance

#### Encapsulation in OOP
Bundling of data with the functions that operate on that data into a single unit.
We can restrict the access of a function or variable to a single unit or a single class.

#### Benefits of Encapsulation
* Keeps the data and the code safe from external interference
* Prevents accidental modification of data.
* Better for unit testing.

#### Abstraction in OOP
Hiding unwanted details while showing the most essential information.

#### Benefits of Abstraction:
* Ease of use for the end user
* Reduce complexity of design
* Increase security and confidentiality

#### Inheritance in OOP
New class can inherit methods and attributes from existing classes.

#### Benefits of inheritance
* Code reusability and readability
* Avoid code repetition
* Program structure is short and concise

#### Polymorphism in OOP
Refers to defining multiple functionalities under the same name.

e.g.
```python
class triangle_operations()
    def area_calc()

class circle_operations()
    def area_calc()
```
In above example, both of the class have same function name but it will work differently in both of the cases.

#### Benefits of Polymorphism
* Increases code reusability
* Single variable can be used to store multiple data types.


#### Question: Which two features of OOP are similar?
Encapsulation and Abstraction

Encapsulation hides the features of the object and binds all the properties inside a single class. And abstraction is a feature that shows the required data to the user.
