## Setting up system for Testing

* Pre-design of code before implementation
* Break program into modules
* Document constraints and specifications
* Document assumptions behind code design

#### Rediness for testing
* Ensure the code runs
    * Remove syntax errors
    * Remove semantic errors

* Have a set of expected results
    * An input
    * For each input, the expected output
