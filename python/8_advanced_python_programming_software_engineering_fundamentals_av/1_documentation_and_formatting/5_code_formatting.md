## Code Formatting

* Indentation
* Character spacing e.g. def get_details(first_name, last_name)
* Logical Code Blocks (2 line space after every function)

#### Why to format code?
* Code is written once.
* Read while testing
* Read during peer review
* Read before reusing code

#### Code Style
* Code format with strict conventions
* Install `black` for code formatting
    ```bash
    pip install nb_black
    ```
* Load black in jupyter lab
    ```bash
    %load_ext lab_black
    ```
* Load black in jupyter notebook
    ```bash
    %load_ext nb_black
    ```
