    "Two cards from an ordinary deck of 52 cards are missing. What is the probability that a random card drawn from this deck is a spade?\n",

    "#### Example 2\n",
    "Suppose you are in a game show and you are given three doors. Behind one door is a car and behind the other two doors are goats. Now the host of the game show asks you to pick one door.  Note that he knows what is behind which door. Suppose you choose one of the doors among these three. Now, out of the remaining two doors,  the host reveals one door which has a goat behind it. And makes a very interesting proposal to you.\n",
    "\n",
    "He asks you if you want to stick to the choice of your door or want to choose the door that has not been revealed yet ? What should you do?\n",
    "\n",
    "If “the host, who knows what’s behind the doors” opens a door that has a goat, then the probability the car was behind that door was 0 before the door was opened (actually, as soon as the car was placed behind a door). Since the host knows which door has the car behind it, then the probability that the car is behind that door is 1. Hence, the probability of winning by switching is either 0 (if the host knows that door does not have the car behind it) or 1 (if the host knows that door does have the car behind it), not 2/3.\n",
    "\n",
    "Proof–\n",
    "\n",
    "Let E1, E2 and E3 be 3 Events, such that \n",
    "\n",
    "E1=Car is behind door 1, \n",
    "\n",
    "E2=Car is behind door 2,\n",
    "\n",
    "E3=Car is behind door 3\n",
    "\n",
    "And consider another event A, such that A=The host opens door 3\n",
    "\n",
    "So, we basically have to find the probability P(E1 |A), which basically means “What is the probability that the car is behind door 1, given that the host has already opened door 3”.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, according to Bayes’ theorem, we can write this probability as-\n",
    "\n",
    "P(E1|A) = P(A|E1).P(E1) / P(A|E1).P(E1) + P(A|E2).P(E2) + P(A|E3).P(E3)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now here, we have probabilities P(E1)=P(E2)=P(E3)=1/3, since it was previously equally likely that the car can be either behind door 1, or door 2, or door 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, P(A│E1)=Probability that the host has opened door 3, given the car is behind door 1 = 1/2, since the host can open door 2 or door 3, since they both don’t have the car behind them.\n",
    "\n",
    "And, we have P(A│E2)=Probability that the host has opened door 3, given that the car is behind door 2 = 1, because if the car is behind door 2, then the only door that the host can open is door 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "And, P(A│E3)=Probability that the host has opened door 3, given that the car is behind door 3 = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "This is because the probability of the host opening the door that has the car behind it was 0 according to the question since he never opens the door having the car behind it.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, putting all these values in the above formula, we get-\n",
    "\n",
    "P(E1|A) = (1/2 * 1/3) / (1/2 * 1/3) + (1* 1/3) + (0 * 1/3) = (1/6) / (1/2) = 1/3\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, we can see that there is a 1/3  chance that the car is behind door 1 ⇒ there is a 1−1/3=2/3  chance that the car is behind door 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, you should switch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Or \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two cases here :\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Switching\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Not switching\n",
    "\n",
    "Case 1 :\n",
    "\n",
    "If we know we are switching, we need to select a door which has a goat in order to win the car. As we select a door having a goat, the host should only open the door that have the another goat so the remaining door has a car which we get by switching.\n",
    "\n",
    "So probability of selecting a door which has a goat is 2/3 as 2 doors out of 3 have goats.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore probability of winning a car by switching is 2/3.\n",
    "\n",
    "Case 2 :\n",
    "\n",
    "If we know we are not switching, we need to select a door which has a car in order to win the car. \n",
    "\n",
    "So probability of selecting a door which has a car is 1/3 as 1 door out of 3 has car.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore probability of winning a car by not switching is 1/3.\n",
    "\n",
    "As probability of winning a car by switching is higher than not switching. It is advantage to switch.\n"
