## What is data science?

Data Science = Data + Science

The field of brining out `insights from data` using scientific techniques is called Data Science.

#### Spectrum of Business Analysis
* MIS: What happened?
* Detective analysis: Why did it happen?
* Dashboarding: what's happening now?
* Predictive modeling: What is likely to happen?
* Big data: What can happen, given I collect and use all possible data.


#### Forecasting vs Predictive Modeling vs Machine learning
`Forecasting` is a process of predicting or estimating the future based on past and present data.

Examples:
* How many passengers can we expect in a given flight?
* How many customer calls can we expect in next hour?


`Predictive modeling` used to perform prediction more granular like "who are the customers who are likely to buy a product in next month?" and then act accordingly.

`Machine learning` is a method of teaching machines to learn things and improve predictions / behavior based on data on their own.

Examples:
* Create an algorithm which can power Google search
* Amazon recommendation system.
